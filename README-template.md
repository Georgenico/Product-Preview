## Overview


### The challenge

At first, its really hard to understand how to default all of your works from desktop to mobile view. I don't how to do it until I figured it out using display: flex; flex-start.

### Screenshot

I'm having a hard time moving the icon to the left to give them a space between. 
I tried to give the icon position: relativ; and right: 5px but its not working since the its showing position: static; can anyone help me with this? Thank you!

### What I learned

It's fun and exciting at the same time, I undertood the how the flexbox work and how to use media query.


### Continued development
